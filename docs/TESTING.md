# Modern Paint Studio Pro - Testing Framework 🧪

A comprehensive testing suite for validating all functionality, performance, and user experience of Modern Paint Studio Pro.

## 🧪 Testing Overview

Our testing framework consists of three layers:

### 1. **Unit Tests** (`tests.cpp`)
- Core functionality validation
- Algorithm correctness (HSV↔RGB, calculations)
- Data structure integrity
- Performance benchmarks
- **~30 automated tests**

### 2. **Integration Tests** (`integration_tests.cpp`)
- Real application launch and UI interaction
- Window management and responsiveness
- Memory usage validation
- Drawing system integration
- **~15 automated tests**

### 3. **Manual Testing** (`run_tests.bat`)
- User experience validation
- Visual quality assurance
- Feature interaction testing
- **Guided manual test scenarios**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run All Tests (Recommended)
```bash
make test-all
# or
./run_tests.bat
```

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Unit tests only
make test

# Integration tests only  
make test-integration

# Build all test executables
make build-all
```

## 🛠️ Test Framework Features

### Custom Test Framework (`test_framework.h`)
```cpp
// Simple assertions
ASSERT_TRUE(condition)
ASSERT_FALSE(condition)
ASSERT_EQ(expected, actual)
ASSERT_NE(expected, actual)

// Test organization
framework.AddSuite("Suite Name");
framework.AddTest("Test Name", testFunction);
framework.RunAllTests();
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Execution time tracking (per test)
- Memory usage validation
- CPU performance benchmarks
- UI responsiveness testing

### Automated Reporting
- ✓/✗ Test result indicators
- Execution time reporting
- Success rate calculation
- Detailed failure messages

## 🔧 Build System Integration

### Make Targets
```bash
make test          # Run unit tests
make test-integration  # Run integration tests  
make test-all      # Run comprehensive test suite
make build-all     # Build main app + all tests
make ci            # Continuous integration build
```

### Continuous Integration
The `make ci` target runs:
1. Clean build environment
2. Build main application
3. Build all test suites
4. Run unit tests
5. Run integration tests
6. Generate test report

## 🐛 Debugging Failed Tests

### Unit Test Failures
- Check algorithm implementations
- Validate constants and ranges  
- Review data structure definitions
- Verify performance benchmarks

### Integration Test Failures
- Ensure application builds correctly
- Check window creation and display
- Validate UI interaction sequences
- Review memory usage patterns

### Common Issues
- **GDI+ not initialized**: Include gdiplus lib
- **Window not found**: Check window class name
- **Click coordinates wrong**: Verify UI layout constants
- **Memory test fails**: Check for memory leaks
